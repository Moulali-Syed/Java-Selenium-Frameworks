Testing : to check whether application is working as per customer requirement

Regression Testing: multiple teams work in a project , if we have developer they r responsible for developing software - dev perform integration . unit testing
	tester will test the functionality , dev gives build and tester will install and test it in test environment
	dev will not do all functionlities in a single , one version may have some functionality , some will be in other
	if some defects raised , dev will add new features and fix the defects raised in previous build , bug fixes
	everytime a new build will be coming , in every cycle it will be going

	once we get new build , verify the testcases reported with defects , also new test cases and do regression testing
	to check if something is whteher impacted due to new build , thus we have to run all testcases to make sure no functionality
	which is working previously is working fine

	thus we have to do this regression testing , using automated testcases

Retesting : executing same test case , same steps doing repetitively
if done manually a lot of work,and takes much time
Positive scenarios and negative scenarios

lets see how we can overcome these challenges
how automation testing overcome manual testing challneges
if we do manual testing we have to verify each step , and perform them in application

if we automate our testcase , each and every step must be communicated to tool that will execute our testcase
as soon as we get a new build we can execute testcase automatically

Why selenium is required?
Selenium is a automation tool , web based automation tool
Selenium can automate only web based apps , which ever can run in browser , free tool , selenium WebDriver[is what to be used],RC[deprecated], Selenium IDE[record playback]

Advantages:
1.open source
2.supports multiple OS
3.supports multiple browsers
4.supports multiple langauges - java ,python , C# ,ruby [32 minutes]
5.Integrate 3rd party tools: Apache POI , Sikuli , Auto IT , Extent Reports

Limitations:
1.cannot support windows based applications[AutoIT, sikuli]
all software applications are 3 kinds - web based , mobile , window based applications
2.Reporting not supported [TestNG,ExtentReports]
3.cannot support excel files [Apache POI]
4.graphs

Selenium Versions:
selenium 1.x --> IDE[firefox],RC ,Grid
selenium 2.x --> IDE[firefox],WebDriver,Grid
selenium 3.x --> IDE[chrome,firefox],WebDriver,Grid
